# Rock Paper Scissors Project

A simple rock paper scissors game with a html/css GUI. One of the projects from the Odin Project [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations). This was my first real application of JavaScript. It involved manipulating the DOM and figuring out some of JS's *cough* intricacies.
